The project is build using Ruby 2.1.5 and Rails 4.2.0. Both of which are required to be installed on the system in order to run the application.

The database used for the development is PostgreSQL 9.4, however if you wish you can use another database, but this needs to be configure according in
the config/database.yml file of this project.

To run the project you can simply import it into IntelliJ IDEA IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/help/importing-project-from-existing-source-code.html)
and change the database connection settings in config/database.yml
Once this is done the application can be run with a server of your choice.

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
